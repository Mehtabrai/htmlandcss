        <p id="one" >This is applied when a user 
            hovers over an element with a 
            pointing device such as a mouse. 
            This has commonly been used 
            to change the appearance of 
            links and buttons when a user 
            places their cursor over them. It 
            is worth noting that such events 
            do not work on devices that use 
            touch screens (such as the iPad) 
            because the screen is not able to 
            tell when someone is hovering 
            their finger over an element.
